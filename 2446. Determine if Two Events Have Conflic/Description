You are given two arrays of strings that represent two inclusive events that happened on the same day, event1 and event2, where:
您将获得两个字符串数组，它们表示同一天发生的两个包含事件 event1 和 event2 ，其中：

    event1 = [startTime1, endTime1] and  event1 = [startTime1, endTime1] 和
    event2 = [startTime2, endTime2].

Event times are valid 24 hours format in the form of HH:MM.
事件时间以 HH:MM 的形式有效 24 小时格式。

A conflict happens when two events have some non-empty intersection (i.e., some moment is common to both events).
当两个事件有一些非空的交集（即，两个事件共有某个时刻）时，就会发生冲突。

Return true if there is a conflict between two events. Otherwise, return false.
如果两个事件之间存在冲突，则返回 true 。否则，返回 false 。

 

Example 1:

Input: event1 = ["01:15","02:00"], event2 = ["02:00","03:00"]
Output: true
Explanation: The two events intersect at time 2:00.

Example 2:

Input: event1 = ["01:00","02:00"], event2 = ["01:20","03:00"]
Output: true
Explanation: The two events intersect starting from 01:20 to 02:00.

Example 3:

Input: event1 = ["10:00","11:00"], event2 = ["14:00","15:00"]
Output: false
Explanation: The two events do not intersect.

 

Constraints:

    evnet1.length == event2.length == 2.
    event1[i].length == event2[i].length == 5
    startTime1 <= endTime1
    startTime2 <= endTime2
    All the event times follow the HH:MM format.
    所有事件时间都遵循 HH:MM 格式。
